                <p1>Narendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950 in Vadnagar, Gujarat, in a middle-class family. His early life was marked by simplicity and struggle, as he helped his father sell tea at a railway station. These experiences shaped his understanding of poverty, discipline, and hard work. He completed his schooling in Vadnagar and later pursued higher education in Political Science, earning degrees from Delhi University and Gujarat University.
                    Modi joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) during his youth, where he developed strong organizational and leadership skills. As a full-time worker, he dedicated his life to social service and nation-building. In the 1980s, he joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and worked as a key strategist, helping strengthen the party at the national level.
                    In 2001, Narendra Modi became the Chief Minister of Gujarat. During his nearly 13 years in office, the state saw rapid development in infrastructure, electricity supply, road networks, and industrial growth. Initiatives like the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit attracted investors from India and abroad. His tenure also faced criticism and controversy, but it played a major role in shaping his national image.
                    Modi led the BJP to a historic victory in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, becoming the 14th Prime Minister of India. He was re-elected in 2019 with an even stronger mandate. As Prime Minister, he introduced several important schemes such as Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Make in India, Digital India, Startup India, Jan Dhan Yojana, Ujjwala Yojana, and Ayushman Bharat, aiming to improve sanitation, employment, digital access, healthcare, and financial inclusion.
                    His government implemented major economic reforms like the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and promoted digital payments. Modi also emphasized national security, self-reliance through Atmanirbhar Bharat, and technological advancement. On the global stage, he strengthened India’s relations with many countries and promoted Indian culture internationally, including the celebration of International Yoga Day.
                    Narendra Modi is known for his strong leadership style, powerful speeches, and direct communication with citizens through programs like Mann Ki Baat. While opinions about his policies may differ, there is no doubt that he has played a significant role in shaping modern India and continues to be one of the most influential leaders in the country.Narendra Modi has also placed strong emphasis on social welfare and inclusive development. His government introduced programs aimed at improving the lives of women, farmers, and economically weaker sections of society. Schemes such as Beti Bachao Beti Padhao focus on the protection and education of the girl child, while PM Kisan Samman Nidhi provides financial assistance to farmers. Through Housing for All (Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana), millions of families have gained access to affordable housing, contributing to better living standards across rural and urban areas.
                    Another important aspect of Modi’s leadership is his focus on technology, innovation, and future-ready governance. He has encouraged the use of digital platforms to improve transparency and efficiency in government services. Initiatives promoting startups, innovation, renewable energy, and space technology have helped position India as a growing global power. </p1>
